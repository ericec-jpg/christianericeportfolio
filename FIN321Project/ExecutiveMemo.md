## 1. Executive Overview
The firm is scheduled to receive €11.49 million from a European enterprise client in twelve months. Translating at today’s EUR/USD 1.0875 yields $12.5 million, aligned with FY26 guidance. Given elevated dollar volatility, an unhedged position risks unfavorable translation if the euro weakens. Hedging now secures cash conversion and protects EBITDA targets tied to this flagship managed-services engagement.

## 2. Risk Assessment
- **Directional exposure:** A stronger USD lowers USD receipts; each 0.01 decline in EUR/USD reduces cash by roughly $114,900.
- **Market backdrop:** Divergence between Federal Reserve and ECB policy has widened rate differentials, favoring USD strength and increasing downside risk.
- **Sensitivity:** At EUR/USD 1.03, receipts fall to about $11.84 million (−5.3% vs. plan); at 1.12, receipts rise to $12.87 million (+3.0%).

## 3. Hedge Alternatives
| Strategy | Execution Detail | USD Outcome (Indicative) | Key Considerations |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| **Forward Contract** | Sell €11.49M forward at 1.0910 | Locks ≈$12.53M | Eliminates risk but forgoes upside; requires credit line. |
| **Option Collar** | Buy EUR put @1.0900 (pay $0.017); sell EUR call @1.1300 (receive ≈$0.012) | Net floor ≈$12.52M; upside capped above 1.1300 | Lower net premium; retains partial upside; option documentation needed. |
| **Money-Market Hedge** | Borrow present value of USD at 4.85%, convert to EUR, invest at 3.15% | Synthetic forward ≈$12.52M | Uses balance sheet capacity; unwind costly if contract changes. |

## 4. Recommendation
Adopt a 12-month EUR/USD forward at 1.0910 for 100% of exposure to protect FY26 guidance. Layer a contingent collar on incremental euro inflows if commercial negotiations expand scope. Forward pricing offers certainty without cash premium and aligns with the firm’s risk appetite. Confirm counterparty limits and hedge accounting designation before trade execution.

## 5. Implementation Plan
1. Obtain treasury approval and confirm ISDA/CSA documentation with relationship bank.
2. Execute €11.49M forward sale for settlement 25 Oct 2026; ensure trade booking in TMS.
3. Monitor option markets weekly; if EUR rallies above 1.11, evaluate cost-effective collars for incremental receipts.
4. Update forecasting model and communicate hedged rate to FP&A and Investor Relations.

## 6. Assumptions & Next Actions
- Rates, forward points, and option premiums are indicative as of 25 Oct 2025; refresh prior to execution.
- No transaction costs, taxes, or credit valuation adjustments included.
- Legal review of hedge documentation remains outstanding.

**Next Actions:**
- Build scenario workbook quantifying USD receipts across ±10% FX moves and hedge payoffs.
- Finalize treasury policy addendum covering option usage thresholds.
- Schedule follow-up with CFO to confirm hedge scope and accounting treatment.
